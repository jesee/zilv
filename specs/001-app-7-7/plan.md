# Implementation Plan: Self-Discipline Point System App

**Branch**: `001-app-7-7` | **Date**: 2025-09-13 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-app-7-7/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

## Summary
This plan outlines the implementation of a self-discipline mobile application using Flutter. The app allows users to track positive and negative behaviors via a point system, manage a list of behaviors, and set reminders. The technical approach is a standalone mobile application with local storage, ensuring offline capability.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Dart (with Flutter)
**Primary Dependencies**: `flutter_local_notifications`, `sqflite`, `provider`
**Storage**: SQLite for structured data and `shared_preferences` for settings.
**Testing**: `flutter_test` (Unit, Widget), `integration_test`
**Target Platform**: Android, iOS
**Project Type**: Mobile
**Performance Goals**: Smooth UI (60 fps), quick database operations (<50ms).
**Constraints**: Must function offline.
**Scale/Scope**: Single-user application.

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: [1] (The Flutter app)
- Using framework directly? (Yes)
- Single data model? (Yes)
- Avoiding patterns? (Yes, starting with a simple service layer)

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? (N/A for this single-app structure, but logic will be modularized)
- Libraries listed: `services`, `models`, `ui`
- CLI per library: (N/A)
- Library docs: (N/A)

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? (Yes)
- Git commits show tests before implementation? (Will be enforced)
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed? (Yes, service contracts first)
- Real dependencies used? (N/A for local db, but no mocking of the db itself)
- Integration tests for: new libraries, contract changes, shared schemas? (Yes)
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test, skipping RED phase (Yes)

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included? (Will be added)
- Frontend logs → backend? (N/A)
- Error context sufficient? (Will be ensured)

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? (0.1.0)
- BUILD increments on every change? (Yes)
- Breaking changes handled? (N/A for initial version)

**Structure Decision**: Option 3 (Mobile), adapted for a pure Flutter project structure.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - All unknowns have been resolved.

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   - Research completed.

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md`
   - Done.

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`: Done.
2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements → `/contracts/services.md`: Done.
3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts: To be done in the implementation phase.
4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories → `quickstart.md`: Done.
5. **Update agent file incrementally**: Skipped due to script error.

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, quickstart.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each entity in `data-model.md` → model creation task [P]
- Each service in `contracts/services.md` → service interface and failing test task
- Each user story in `quickstart.md` → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make all tests pass, following the UI structure.

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Models → Services → UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: ~20-25 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| (None)    |            |                                     |

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [ ] Complexity deviations documented
