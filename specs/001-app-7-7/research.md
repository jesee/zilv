# Research & Decisions

## Technology Stack

- **Decision**: Flutter will be used for the mobile application framework.
- **Rationale**: The user explicitly requested a Flutter implementation to target both Android and iOS with a unified codebase and UI style. This aligns perfectly with Flutter's capabilities.
- **Alternatives considered**: Native development (Swift/Kotlin) was considered but rejected as it would require separate development efforts for each platform, contradicting the user's goal of a unified style.

## State Management

- **Decision**: Provider will be used for state management.
- **Rationale**: It is a simple, flexible, and widely-used state management solution in the Flutter community. It's a good starting point for an application of this scope.
- **Alternatives considered**: BLoC, Riverpod. These are more complex and better suited for larger applications. We can migrate if needed in the future.

## Local Storage

- **Decision**: `shared_preferences` will be used for simple key-value storage (like user settings) and a local SQLite database (using the `sqflite` package) for structured data like behaviors and log entries.
- **Rationale**: This combination provides a lightweight solution for settings and a robust, queryable database for the core application data, which will work offline.
- **Alternatives considered**: Hive, Isar. These are also good options, but SQLite is a well-established standard.

## Notifications

- **Decision**: The `flutter_local_notifications` package will be used to handle scheduled reminders.
- **Rationale**: It's a feature-rich and reliable package for managing local notifications on both Android and iOS.
- **Alternatives considered**: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM). FCM is for push notifications and would require a backend, which is not specified for this phase. Local notifications are sufficient for the described requirements.
